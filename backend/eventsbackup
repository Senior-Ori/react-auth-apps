      "description": "Samantha Eve Wilkins is a former classmate of Mark's and member of the Teen Team. Eve was created as a result of a government experiment to create super-beings. She can manipulate all matter, although a mental block has previously stopped her from creating and manipulating living things. Eventually, she and Mark realize their true feelings for each other and the pair start dating, fall in love, and get married after Eve gives birth to their daughter Terra. Eventually, she breaks her previous mental limits and her powers are bolstered to nigh-omnipotent levels, though she retains the discipline to not utilize it on other beings. Breaking her limits allows her to mimic Mark's Viltrumite powers, namely heat vision (which Kirkman and Ottley describe as 1000x more powerful than Superman's)",
